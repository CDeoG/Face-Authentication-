# Face-Authentication-
Face Authentication is a technology that enables people to access online services, physical settings, and other resources using images of their face. Face authentication, also called face/facial recognition, relies on mobile and other devices' native sensing technology.
Facial recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match.
